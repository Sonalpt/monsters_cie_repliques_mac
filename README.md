# Monstres et cie: Les RÃ©pliques

Monsters Inc.: The Quotes is my first Flutter application, which consists of playing the quotes of favorite characters from the Pixar animated film: Monsters Inc. The creation of this app took place in three steps: learning the basics of the Flutter language in two weeks, then designing the application from A to Z on Figma in three days, and another two weeks to code the application (technically one week, but my stupidity made me lose a week on a sound bug, lol).

## Application link

This is the link to download the app. Unfortunatly, it's only available for Android because currently, I don't have a paid Developer Account on Apple, 
but the app has been tested in both Android and iOS devices.

## Context and why I've created this application

During my brief learning of Flutter basics, I was at my cousin's place and we kept laughing and imitating the characters from Monsters Inc, to joke about a specific situation from our day. That's when the idea came to me to create a mobile app that would allow us to do that super easily!
